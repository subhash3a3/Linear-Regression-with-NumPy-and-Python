# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python

This repository consists of the project code and other details which I learnt from coursera project network.

I this project, I created a univariate regrssion model without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, keras and tensorflow. The model was trained with a city population vs. profit datset of a bike company who want to know to which city they have to expand their business.
